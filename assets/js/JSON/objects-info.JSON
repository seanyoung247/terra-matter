The A+++ rating is the most energy efficient and G is the least efficient. Appliances with a lower rating cost much more to run than those with a high rating. So, if you have a lot of white goods e.g. washing machine, fridge/freezer, or oven with a low rating, it might be worth replacing them with more efficient models sooner rather than later, in order to save the Earth and your money."
