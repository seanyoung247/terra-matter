## Local Deployment

### Cloning

When a repository is created on GitHub, it is located on GitHub website (“remotely”). You can create a copy of the repository locally on your machine. This process is called : “**Cloning a repository**”.  
When cloning a repository you are actually copying all the data that the repository contains at that time to your machine.

To clone a repository, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Click on the **Code** dropdown button above the files list.
3. There are three options available to clone the repository :
    * using HTTPS
    * using SSH key
    * using GitHub CLI  

![clone options](assets/README-images/deployment/cloning.png)

4. Choose an option and copy the link given.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Open your IDE and in the CLI type : ```git clone``` and paste the link copied on step 4.

>```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```

7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

For further information please go to [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line).

### Using GitPod

To Clone a repository Using GitPod, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Install the GitPod [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) for Chrome or [Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/) for Firefox.
3. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
4. Click on the **GitPod** button on the top right of the files list.
5. This will open a workspace on GitPod where you can work on the repository locally.

>The very first time that you do this, you need to connect GitPod and GitHub together. You need to log in with GitHub and launch your workspace (As explain above). And then you need to authorize GitPod to be able to access your GitHub account. You agree to GitPod's terms and conditions, and then create a free account. Then, it will open the workspace for you.
Quote from : “Creating a GitPod Workspace” on [Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Programme](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/), by Matt Rudge.

### Using GitHub Desktop

Another option is available : GitHub Desktop. It consists of cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop.  
For full information about how to use this option, please visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

### Forking

Forking a repository will copy it in your own repositories in GitHub.

>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.

To Fork a repository take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
3. Identify the ```fork``` button on the top right of the page and click on it.

![Forking](assets/README-images/deployment/fork.png)

4. Now you should find a copy of the repository in ```Your repositories```.

## Implementing API

[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) is used in this project in order to manage the contact form of the website.  
It is an API (Application Programming Interface), that allows emails management using JavaScript, without needing the server side.

To implement EmailJS take the following steps :

1. Create an account by [signing up](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up).
Free account are avaible and was used in this project limiting the number of email to 200 per month.
2. Go to [Email Services](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin) in order to link your email account.
3. Create a template or use the default proposed in [Email Templates](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates).
4. Go to the [Docs → emailjs.send](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/sdk/send/) section in order to see how to implemnt the service. Different options are available.
5. In order to implement the service you will need your **user ID** and **Access Token** that refer to the **API keys**. You will find them in the [integration](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/integration) section of your account.

:warning: **API keys** are private and sensitive information that should not be shared and kept private.
